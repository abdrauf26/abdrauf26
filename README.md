Hi! 👋 I am Rauf from Singapore 🇸🇬. I am an experienced sports educator who found love in data analytics.📉 Since learning about data science and data analytics, it had inspired me  to learn further into the subject realm. 🌱 Everyday  has been a learning journey for me. And I love that ! 

I enjoy appreciating simple things in life such as being present with my family,  learning, reading and discussing about history, real estate, financial literacy and watching footballing geniuses such as Cantona, Riquelme, Zidane, Ronaldiinho and Ronaldo playing the beautiful game. ⚽

💻 My skills that I am developing everyday includes python, Pandas, Numpy, plotly, seaborn, Matplotlib. 

📚 My current project includes :
- [Data Analysis in Singapore Condominiums and Apartments ( 2017 to 2022)](https://github.com/abdrauf26/abdul_rauf_repo)
